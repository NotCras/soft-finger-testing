soft-finger-testing
===================

Code used on an mbed microcontroller to drive a pressure controller. 
This is used to test sensors on a soft pneumatic actuator.

Since its on an mbed, this code will need to be compiled through the mbed online compiler, found here:
https://mbed.org/accounts/login/?next=%2Fcompiler%2F

If you are unable to access the compiler yourself, I have provided the compiled version of my code (.bin file).
